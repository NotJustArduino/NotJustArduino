Bringing only your question or just watching what people are doing is also completely fine.\r\n\r\n### Do you accept beginners / non-members?\r\nYes! We have members of all levels and we are welcoming all to come along. Though if you're becoming a regular we'd like you to become a London Hackspace member to support the space. \r\n\r\n### Getting Started with Arduino\r\nThere are many development boards and ways to explore DIY electronics, Arduino is one of the easiest. We recommend to get a Starter Kit, here are a few good ones [Oomlout](http://oomlout.co.uk/products/arduino-starter-kit-ardx) and [Proto-PIC](http://proto-pic.co.uk/proto-pic-arduino-starter-kit-for-arduino-uno/) (note we're not affiliated with these suppliers in any ways.) Then you can start to follow instructions on the [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage) page or one of the many [tutorial sites](http://www.ladyada.net/learn/arduino/).\r\n\r\n###  Can you help with...? \r\nThe short answer is \"maybe\". Your best bet is to ask on our mailing list here. Please do at least a little bit of research before asking to help us understand better your project.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nFor more info about our group or projects check out our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/not-just-arduino) or contact [Marc](marc.barto@gmail.com).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
